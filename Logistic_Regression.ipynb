        "\n",
        "  -> Logistic Regression is a statistical method used for binary classification—essentially, it helps predict whether something falls into one category or another, like yes/no, pass/fail, or spam/not spam. Despite its name, it’s actually a classification algorithm rather than a regression one. It uses the logistic (or sigmoid) function to map predicted values to probabilities between 0 and 1, which is useful for classification tasks\n",

        "\n",
        "  -> Regularization in Logistic Regression is a technique used to prevent overfitting by adding a penalty to the complexity of the model. It ensures that the model generalizes well to unseen data rather than memorizing the training data\n",
        "\n",
        "  Why is Regularization Needed?\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Overfitting: When the model learns too much from the training data, it may fit noise rather than the actual pattern, leading to poor performance on new data.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - High Variance Problem: Without regularization, Logistic Regression can assign excessively large weights to features, making it sensitive to minor variations in data.\n",
